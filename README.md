# Introduction to Styled Theme Variants

Example repo with demostration using Styled Theme Variants

Install packages

`yarn install`

run Storybook:

`yarn storybook`

This loads the stories from `./stories`.

> NOTE: Stories should reference the components as if using the library, similar to the example playground. This means importing from the root project directory. This has been aliased in the tsconfig and the storybook webpack config as a helper.
